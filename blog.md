# Looking into Stephen Ramsay Reading Machines: Toward an Algorithmic Criticism


**What is Ramsay saying? His point?**

   Overall Stephen Ramsay’s Reading Machines is focusing on situating computers within literary analysis, specifically in the digital humanities. Computers can be used for far more than what the average person puts them through each day. Ramsay talks about how these “reading machines” (the computers) can open up a world of possibilities looking at literary analysis in the digital humanities. Computational analysis of text has mostly been used to organize and index digital text. Although computational analysis of text has been around, it has not yet seen its potential in the digital humanities using interpretive analysis. Computers allow for tasks that are too much work and not efficient enough for any single person to complete. This is because of the magnitude of data computers can look through in such little time. They also benefit the way literary text analysis tasks were done previously. 
   In chapter 5 of Reading Machines Ramsay talks of Martin Mueller and his work with the text analysis system WordHoard. Ramsay goes on to provide an example of Mueller’s work and talk about its importance. “I call attention to the spur-of-the-moment character of his investigations, not to suggest that one could not conduct elaborate experiments involving word frequency (many have done so), but simply to point out the ways in which this operation has been made virtually effortless by digital technology. The creation of WordHoard required many hours of careful programming and design, but that effort is minimal in comparison to what was required of those who created the first dictionaries and concordances-or even, for that matter, the first books. If Alfred North Whitehead was correct, the result of such effortlessness represents not just the formation of a new convenience but also an epochal moment for civilization, which, he thought, “advances by adding to the number of important operations which we can perform without thinking about them”.” (Ramsay, 2011, p. 69). This example plays into Ramsay’s point about computers bringing new possibilities to text analysis within the digital humanities.


**What is text analysis?**

   Argamon and Olsen of Digital Humanities Quarterly discuss text analysis and how it is transforming. “Traditional models of text analysis in digital humanities have concentrated on searching for a relatively small number of words and reporting results in formats long familiar to humanities scholars, most notably concordances, collocation tables, and word frequency breakdowns. While effective for many types of questions, this approach will not scale effectively beyond collections of a relatively modest size, as result sets for even uncommon groups of words will balloon to a size not readily digestible by humans. Furthermore, this approach does not lend itself to abstract discussions of entire works, the oeuvre of an author or period, or issues related to the language of gender, genre, or ethnicity. It places the onus on the user to construct queries and assimilate results, without leveraging the capacity of machines to identify patterns in massive amount of data.” (Argamon & Olsen, 2009). Programs such as Google Book Search are setup to read through mass amounts of text indexing and organizing them. These programs are making text analysis more efficient and completing tasks that were not humanly possible before. “Machine learning and text mining approaches appear to offer a compelling complement to traditional text analysis, by having the computer sift through massive amounts of text looking for "suggestive patterns." The power of modern machine learning systems to uncover patterns in large amounts of data has led to their widespread use in many applications, from spam filters to analyzing genetic sequences. And the potential for using these sophisticated algorithms to find meaningful patterns in humanistic texts has been recently observed.” (Argamon & Olsen, 2009).


**Examples of text analysis using Ramsay’s Reading Machines.**

   In order to provide examples of computation text analysis I created some text visualizations of Ramsay’s Reading Machines using Voyant.

Voyant Links tool. Visualizing connections between key terms within Ramsay's *Reading Machines*. (Figure above)

There are some points worth noting when looking at some of the key terms highlighted above. Most of the connections between terms make a lot of sense, for example “data” and “computer” as well as “text” with “analysis”.  The connection between “computer” and “literary” speak to Ramsay’s forward thinking when it comes to computational text analysis becoming more relevant in literature.

Voyant frequency graph. Comparing the use of terms **computer** and **literary**. (Figure above)

I decided to compare the terms “computer” and “literary” in the frequency graph above since they appeared connected in my Voyant Links visualization. Interesting enough this connection seems irrelevant when looking at the contrasting curves on the graph above. The curves are quite opposite of each other. The terms vary in frequency and yet they are still related terms.


**My issue with where text analysis is going. (According to Ramsay)**

   Literature is an artform. These programs offer up data about text patterns and word frequencies within a text. A computer algorithm cannot handle how a text is suppose to make you feel or present information on quirky writing styles. Computation text analysis is pushing literature towards a science and not recognizing it as the art it is. These algorithms can be useful in many scenarios but sometimes you just need to read without counting the words on the page.
