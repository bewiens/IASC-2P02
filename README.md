## Bio

Currently a student at Brock University in the Interactive Arts and Science program. Artist and musician looking to expand my knowledge in design and digital media. I've been playing drums for eight years and guitar for four. My whole life I have been drawing and creating art. I have recently begun filming and editing videos for my YouTube channel. In my two years at Brock I've learned and gained experience in commuter applications such as, Adobe Photoshop, Adobe Illustrator, Adobe Premiere, Maya, and a few others. I've also worked with coding languages including HTML, python, and CSS. In learning these tools I have opened new doors and have been able to experiment with my skills and knowledge of design, art, and digital media.
